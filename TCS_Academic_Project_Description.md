# Academic Project Description for TCS NextStep

## Project: Career Compass AI

I developed "Career Compass AI," a comprehensive AI-powered career guidance and skill analysis platform as my academic project. This full-stack application helps users assess their skills and receive personalized career recommendations.

The project utilizes FastAPI for the backend with SQLAlchemy ORM and SQLite database, while the frontend is built using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Key features include skill assessment, gap analysis, personalized learning path generation, career matching, and an AI-powered chatbot for career guidance.

I implemented JWT-based authentication, RESTful API endpoints, and integrated advanced AI components including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), embeddings for skill similarity, and LLM services. The application is containerized using Docker with nginx for deployment and Prometheus for monitoring.

This project enhanced my skills in full-stack development, AI/ML integration, and modern software engineering practices.
