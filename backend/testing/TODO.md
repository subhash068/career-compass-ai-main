# TODO: Fix ImportError in backend/app.py

- [x] Edit backend/app.py to change all relative imports (starting with 'from .') to absolute imports (starting with 'from ')
- [x] Fix all model files to use absolute imports for database module
- [ ] Test the application by running `python backend/app.py` to ensure no ImportError occurs
