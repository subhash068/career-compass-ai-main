## Data Flow Patterns

1. **Assessment Flow**: User → SkillAssessment → UserSkill updates
2. **Recommendation Flow**: UserSkill + CareerSkill → AI Engine → Recommendation
3. **Learning Flow**: Recommendation → LearningPath generation → Progress tracking
4. **Admin Flow**: Admin → Entity management → System updates

## Design Principles Applied

- **Normalization**: Separate tables prevent data redundancy
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys ensure data integrity
- **Extensibility**: Design supports adding new skills/careers easily
- **Performance**: Indexes on foreign keys optimize queries
- **Security**: User isolation prevents data cross-contamination

This entity design provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable system that can evolve with changing requirements while maintaining data integrity and performance.
